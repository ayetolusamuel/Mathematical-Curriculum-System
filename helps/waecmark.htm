<strong>Many students can pass Mathematics if they understand how <a class="zem_slink" title="WAEC" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=33.729323,-84.32201&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=33.729323,-84.32201%20%28WAEC%29&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation" rel="nofollow">WAEC</a> examiners mark their papers and if their tutors show them the way practically by marking  their scripts same way during school tests.

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#008000;"><strong>2. HOW EXAMINERS AWARD MARKS</strong></span><br />
<strong>i. Marks are subdivided into</strong><br />
<strong> a. Method (M)</strong><br />
<strong> b. Accuracy (A)</strong><br />
<strong> c. Independent accuracy marks not preceded by M mark (B)</strong><br />
<strong> ii. The M mark is given for a particular stage if the method used is correct. That is if correctly done without numerical errors yielding the right answer. M marks are not subdivided and unless the M marks for a stage have been awarded no A marks can be gained for that stage</strong><br />
<strong> iii. Examiners will deduct 2 marks if you misread and present the data given falsely.</strong><br />
<strong> iv. Examiners will deduct 1 mark for an answer not given to the accuracy asked for.</strong><br />
<strong> v. Deductions under iii and iv above shall not be more than once on each occasion in one question</strong><br />
<strong> vi. 1 mark is deductible for premature approximations which do not considerably simplify the subsequent work. Deductions can only be made from A or B marks and not from M marks.</strong><br />
<strong> vii. Examiners will give zero for results obtained from work they cannot decipher or which is wholly suppressed and 1 mark is deductible for omission of an essential working (<a class="zem_slink" title="Mathematical proof" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">essential step</a>).</strong><br />
<strong> viii. Once a correct answer is stated examiners will ignore any further workings beyond that stage.</strong><br />
<strong> ix. For geometric proofs 1 mark is deductible for omission of an essential reason or for a wrong reason given. But this should not be more than once in a question.</strong><br />
<strong> x. 1 mark is to be deducted for omission of units or for wrong units. But this should not be more than once in a question.</strong><br />
<strong> xi. If a single question is attempted on more than one occasion the mark for the best attempt is to be awarded to the student.SOS (see other solutions) shall be written against the others</strong><br />
<strong> xii. If more questions are attempted than the rubric allows the lowest marks per those extra questions will be deleted. MQA meaning MORE <a class="zem_slink" title="Question" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">QUESTIONS</a> ANSWERED will be indicated by the examiner to indicate he was aware while marking.</strong><br />
<strong> xiii. Unless otherwise stated, equivalent methods not specified in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Marking scheme" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marking_scheme" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">marking scheme</a> will be accepted and given appropriate marks.</strong><br />
<strong> xiv. The final total is 100 marks and will be rounded upwards to the nearest whole number.</strong></p>
