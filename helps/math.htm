There was a blithe certainty that came from first comprehending the full Einstein field equations, arabesques of Greek letters clinging tenuously to the page, a gossamer web.  They seemed insubstantial when you first saw them, a string of squiggles.  Yet to follow the delicate tensors as they contracted, as the superscripts paired with subscripts, collapsing mathematically into concrete classical entities - potential; mass; forces vectoring in a curved geometry - that was a sublime experience.  The iron fist of the real, inside the velvet glove of airy mathematics.  ~Gregory Benford, Timescape

Everybody who knew anything about ciphering was called in to consider it. A young man from a high school near here, who made a specialty of mathematics and pimples, and who could readily tell how long a shadow a nine-pound ground-hog would cast at 2 o'clock and 37 minutes P.M., on ground-hog day, if sunny, at the town of Fungus, Dak., provided latitude and longitude and an irregular mass of red chalk be given to him, was secured to jerk a few logarithms in the interests of trade.

The trouble with integers is that we have examined only the very small ones.  Maybe all the exciting stuff happens at really big numbers, ones we can't even begin to think about in any very definite way.  Our brains have evolved to get us out of the rain, find where the berries are, and keep us from getting killed.  Our brains did not evolve to help us grasp really large numbers or to look at things in a hundred thousand dimensions.  ~Ronald L. Graham

The temperature of Heaven can be rather accurately computed.  Our authority is Isaiah 30:26, "Moreover, the light of the Moon shall be as the light of the Sun and the light of the Sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days."  Thus Heaven receives from the Moon as much radiation as we do from the Sun, and in addition 7*7 (49) times as much as the Earth does from the Sun, or 50 times in all.  The light we receive from the Moon is one 1/10,000 of the light we receive from the Sun, so we can ignore that....  The radiation falling on Heaven will heat it to the point where the heat lost by radiation is just equal to the heat received by radiation, i.e., Heaven loses 50 times as much heat as the Earth by radiation.  Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for radiation, (H/E) temperature of the earth (-300K), gives H as 798K (525C).  The exact temperature of Hell cannot be computed....  [However] Revelations 21:8 says "But the fearful, and unbelieving...shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone."  A lake of molten brimstone means that its temperature must be at or below the boiling point, 444.6C.  We have, then, that Heaven, at 525C is hotter than Hell at 445C.  ~From Applied Optics, vol. 11, A14, 1972

I've dealt with numbers all my life, of course, and after a while you begin to feel that each number has a personality of its own.  A twelve is very different from a thirteen, for example.  Twelve is upright, conscientious, intelligent, whereas thirteen is a loner, a shady character who won't think twice about breaking the law to get what he wants.  Eleven is tough, an outdoorsman who likes tramping through woods and scaling mountains; ten is rather simpleminded, a bland figure who always does what he's told; nine is deep and mystical, a Buddha of contemplation....  ~Paul Auster, The Music of Chance

From Jurgensen, Brown, and Jurgensen's geometry textbook:
The mathematical education of students at all levels should include information and experiences that will help
them appreciate and value the role of mathematics in the development of modern society. Geometry cannot be
appreciated without some acquaintance with the history of the subject. The general aims can be as follows:
• To make the students aware of the empirical basis of geometry before the time of Euclid.
• To show Euclid as an organizer and codifier of the math of his time.
• To study Descartes and the significance of analytical geometry.
• To study Bolyai and Lobachevsky and the importance of non-Euclidean geometry.
From The Man Who Counted (Malba Tahan, 1993, p97-98):
“Mathematics arose from the awakening of the human soul. The mathematician does not look for truth
with a practical purpose. To cultivate mathematics only for its practical purpose is to despoil the soul of
mathematics. The theory that we study today, and that appears to us impractical, might have
implications in the future that are unimaginable to us. Who can imagine the repercussions of an enigma
through the centuries?
 Mathematics is one of the surest ways for a man to feel the power of thought and the magic of the
spirit. Mathematics is one of the eternal truths and, as such, raises the spirit to the same level on which
we feel the presence of God…Without dreams or imagination, mathematics is impoverished; it is
lifeless.”
