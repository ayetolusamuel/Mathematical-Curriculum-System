<div class=narrow>HOW TO PASS WASSCE AND OTHER EXAMS.<br>
	<br>Student who are yet to gain admission would love this. Even graduate to be no knowlegde is waste. <br><br>As wassce exam draws near. It is therefore important on know the him or her can pass the exam in just on sitting.<br><br>1) Before The Examination <br>(a) Entry: The first stage leading to passing, or getting valid result is proper entry. <br>
	To scale this stage, ensure that you complete your entry correctly. <br>
	Use the examination syllabus and regulation as well as the rules for completing entry document.<br> 
	Many candidates have been known to fail to complete their names, examination numbers, gender codes and choices of subjects correctly, even in the School (May/June) Examination.<br>
	 Such candidates spend useful time asking the examining body to correct the wrong entry.
	 <br>
	 Some even accuse the examining body of responsibility for the error, until the original documents are shown them!
	 <br>
	 <br>
	 (b) Coverage of Syllabuses and Regulations.
	 <br>
	 Get the syllabuses for the subjects chosen and study the topics;
	 <br>
	 listen in class and study later; consult good tutorial colleges if you area private candidate. 
	 <br>
	 Get the required text books and study consistently over a long period. Avoid reliance on "short notes" at the beginning of learning a topic. 
	 <br>
	 Let the facts sink into you. Study the regulations governing examinations, particularly about desired behaviour<br>in examination, so that<br>you do not ignorantly involve yourself in malpractices with serious consequences.
	 <br><br>
	 (c) Learn to answer questions after each topic, to enable you determine how far you assimilated the topic. You may use<br>past questions, or form your own related questions to the topic, answering such questions:-in writing, not gliblyorally.
	 <br><br>
	 (d) Share knowledge and exchange ideas with mates since you may not have access to all textbooks or knowledge on a topic. But DO NOT join in cramming modelanswers prepared by somebody else. <BR>
	 Learn to use your own words to treat or answer questions except where actual quotation is required.
	 <br><br>
	 (e) Determine to face the exam yourself. Avoid relying on people to help you do all or part of the examination; avoid looking for " EXPO" (that is questions that may leak).
	 Disappointment often comes from such. <BR>
	 (f) Locate your examination centre and hall before the date your examination starts,including those for specific subjects that have common centres. You will, thereby, avoid frustration and reduction of passing chances! 
	 <BR>
	 (g) "Commit your way unto the Lord, trust also in Him, He will bring it to pass".
	 <br><br>

	 (2) During The Examination <br>
	 (a) Punctuality to exam centre will enable you use all the time allocated to the exam. <br>
	 Rushing in when a paper had started destabilizes the examinee. Drop bags, books, notes and sheets outside. <br>
	 (b) In practical paper, be sure you stay in the group you are assigned to avoid mix-up of work with other people's . <br>
	 (c) Get your correct exam centre and seat, particularly in multiple centre schools / venues.<br> 
	 (d) Collect and protect your answer booklet, when the supervisor gives it out. Write your name, examination
	 number, subject and sex code (in objective on the booklet). <br>
	 (e) Collect your question paper and guard it jealously. Write yourname on it, immediately you get it, for easy identification when need arises.<br> 
	 (f) When asked to start, take time to read the rubrics/instruction such as the number of questions to answer in all, and from each section. Tick the ones you want to attempt and write your outlines of approach. <br>
	 (g) Answer question precisely and up to the point; think of many points and do not waste time discussing one point<br>to the detriment of others unless the question asks you to. Time yourself on each number to avoid waste of time on one.<br>
	  (h) In objective or multiple answers paper,shade your choices properly. <br>
	  (i) Protect â€œyour work to avoid others spying on your  work and so involve you <br>
	  i: collusion, leading to cancelling of subject result. <br>
	  (j) Remember that you are writing an examination; avoid using pidgin English do not forget your punctuation marks and rules of grammar. Know that all  the rules of grammar and punctuation are marked in the English Language Papers. Many candidates ignore this fact.<br>
	   (k) Towards the end, read over your work to correct errors - particularly your exam number; subject code and question numbers. Cancel rough work neatly to avoid their being marked. <br>
	   (l) When asked to stop -Do so promptly to avoidn conflict with the regulations. Turn your answer sheet or booklet over till the invigilator or supervisor gets to you to collect your answer sheet/booklet. Avoid arguing with the invigilator or supervisor.
	   <br><br>

								<div class="inner" id="msg_69"><strong>Sometimes A questions Like this Can be Asked.</strong> <br /><br />There are many useful methods to help you pass exams but I have here distilled them down to the ten most useful methods. <br /><br />1. Know what the pass mark is. If you know what the pass mark is you can better direct your time and effort <br /><br />2. Read the questions. Most fail because they have not properly read the question. Answer what was asked and only what was asked - not what you think was asked but what was actually asked. <br /><br />3. Look for the answer in the question. Often there are clues to the answer, in the question. If nothing else it will tell you in what format the answer should be in. <br /><br />4. Have a multiple choice technique <br /><br />a. Eliminate the definite wrong answer <br /><br />b. Eliminate the trick answer <br /><br />c. Decide between the rest which most directly answer the question <br /><br /><br />5. Look out for trick questions. Sometimes the questions can be taken the wrong way e.g. explain why a designer should not use modern techniques in high level design - note the word &#039;not&#039;. <br /><br />6. Answer all the questions. Remember a three line notes only essay gets more marks than no answer so answer all questions. It is easier to get the first few marks that the last mark so if time is short leave the fully answered question and try a partial answer to other questions. <br /><br />7. Examine past papers to spot questions. Study of past papers can lead to guessing what part of the syllabus is most likely to come up. <br /><br />8. Use mnemonics to remember key facts <br /><br />9. Practice past papers under exam conditions <br /><br />10. Work out your times in line with question values and- spend more time on questions with more points.<br /><br /><span style="color: blue;" class="bbc_color">
