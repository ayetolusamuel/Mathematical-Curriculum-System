<span style="color: #336666;"><i> <b>"Every examination test  is for three things</b></i>

	<br />


in geneal: knowledge, speed and accuracy". Scoring high in JAMB UTME is not 
only dependent on the amount you know
but the number of questions you are able to
shade correctly in 3hours 30minutes. JAMB 
UTME is one of the national examinations 
that good time management determines
who will pass and who will fail. Many 
students complain after writing the
examination that they were still on Use of 
English when the supervisor announced 1 
hour left. With this secret, you will not be on 
the complaint counter.<br />
Here is a system to write JAMB OR WAEC and 
have 30 minutes spilling over:<br />
* Have a relaxed mind after you have 
cleared at the entrance gate. It means you 
are qualified for the examination.<br />
* While the invigilators are getting the 
materials for the examination, don't discuss 
with those around, rather a simple prayer 
can give you more confidence and a 
relaxed mind. Let your mind roam around 
the things you've read.<br />
* Once you get the question paper, read the 
instruction on the first page carefully.<br />
* Shade your data into the answer sheet as 
neatly as possible.<br />
* Before going into the questions, take 
about six deep breath to allow a good 
inflow of oxygen and as well energize your 
brain for the task at hand.<br />
* Since you have studied the past questions, 
you should have allotted time to different 
subjects with the order they will be 
answered.  Give the least time to the subject 
you know best and larger portion of the 
time to the ones that may be more difficult.<br />
Here is the order I used when I sat JAMB<br />
UTME<br />
Chemistry ======      35 minutes<br />
Mathematics=====     40 minutes<br />
Physics=========    45 minutes<br />
Use of English=====   60 minutes<br />
----------------<br />
180 minutes<br />
----------------<br />
This left 30 minutes as a spill over for me 
and I did every correction I needed, cross 
checked and was confident.<br />
* Start with the questions you know both in 
WAEC and JAMB so as to build self 
confidence. This will let your confidence rise 
such that the fear of failure will disappear 
forever. Nervousness results to careless 
mistake in examinations, but with your self 
confidence raised to the peak, nervousness 
will fall into the bottomless pit.<br />

 Be sure to shade into the right portion of 
the answer script bearing the subject you 
are tackling at the moment. A very brilliant 
friend of mine failed JAMB UTME the first 
time he sat the examination because he 
shaded different subjects in entirely 
different columns from where they were 
meant to be. When he realized his mistake, 
time was already against him.<br />
* This point is very important: have a total 
understanding of each of the questions you 
read before you go on to answer.<br />
* The most important for JAMB CANDIDATES:<br />
if you have practiced JAMB past questions,
you will agree  with me that answers from 
first impression are not always the correct 
answers. This is because the examiner puts 
himself in your shoes, such that whatever 
that will come to your mind first as an 
answer will be in the options, 
notwithstanding, the real answer will also 
be there. JAMB top scorers don't shade 
answers based on first impression. Rather, 
they read and get a good understanding of 
the question and as well solve out the 
correct answers. This is the biggest secret 
of JAMB examination. Remember, top 
scoring is not shading what you think 
should be the answer but shading the 
correct answers.<br />
* Any question that tends to be tough, mark
it with a big asterisk and circle it. It will 
make it easier to be spotted when you 
return to them.<br />
NOTE: scoring high in this examination is 
not only dependent on the amount you 
know but the number of questions you are 
able to shade correctly in hours 30 minutes.<br />
On the average, JAMB expects that you 
answer each question within 45 seconds. So 
any question exceeding that is trying to 
steal your scores instead of adding to it.
Mark such questions with asterisk.<br />
* When you must have finished the ones 
you know, don't forget to return to the one 
marked with asterisk. By this time, you will 
get a clearer understanding of the question 
as you read it a third time.<br />
* Since there is deduction of marks for 
wrong answers, attempt all questions. A
shot in the dark is always  better than
nothing.<br />
* Your presentation matters alot. No matter
how intelligent you are, you stand the risk
of making low grades if you cannot present
your work in a legible manner. If you are
writing WASSCE, try to make your work
legible and as neat as possible.<br />
* Submit your papers according to the
supervisor's instructions.<br />
* Pack your materials and go home for a 
good rest.<br />
If you are writing WASSCE or its equivalence, 
and you have a paper the following day,
don't discuss the ones you've written 
because there is nothing you can change in 
them again. Rather prepare for the papers 
ahead.<br />
This system is what you need to top the list 
of JAMB AND WAEC.<br />

	<b>Tips 1</b>. The JAMB  candidates are 
advised to stay away from the Most
Selected Institutions as outlined below;
<br />
* University Of Lagos (Unilag)<br />
* University Of Benin (Uniben)<br />
* University Of Nigeria (UNN)<br />
* University Of Ilorin (Unilorin)<br />
* Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka. (Unizik)<br />
* Federal University of Technology, Owerri<br />
(Futo)<br />
* University of Ibadan (UI)<br />
* University of Port Harcourt (Uniport)<br />
This are popular-one of the popular-<br />
institutions in 
Nigeria. The reason why we advice that you 
stay away from this universities is to boost 
your chances of admission, not because 
you are not intelligent, but because 
admission slots are very limited, the 
competition in these institutions is higher
and if it is not your catchment area, then 
your chance of getting admitted is equal to 
zero.<br />
But still, if you must choose any of the 
above
institutions, please also look for Universities
that 
accept 2nd choice and that are not too 
competitive. Take note of this as you will 
remember it when Admission commence.<br />
Now success tips 6 will show us courses
that are very competitive and why you
have to ignore them.<br />
<br />



<b>Tips 2</b>. All candidates seeking Admission into<br />
Tertiary Institutions via the JAMB 
 UTME exercise are advice to be 
very careful in their selection of courses, it 
is no news that the following courses have 
the highest number of applicants.<br />
* Medicine And Surgery<br />
* Economics<br />
* Accounting<br />
* Law/Civil Law<br />
* Pharmacy etc.<br />
* Mechanical Engr/civil/elect elect etc.<br />
Selecting one of the above means you will 
be competing with thousands of candidates
for the space, which is likely not up to 
hundreds in all the Institutions. But if you  
are however interested in any of the above 
courses, you must learn how to balance
your selections appropriately to increase
your chances of getting admitted. Ensure
you also select courses that has few
number of candidates, and by so ding, you
can be sure of your Admission and if you
so please, you can apply for change of
course after been admitted.<br />
This is as to boost your chances of
admission, not because you are not
intelligent, but because slots are
limited,competition is higher and you are
getting older, plus, ASUU would make you
age before time,
hence, make hay while the sun shine.<br />
<BR />

<b>Tips 3</b>. It is important also that you know
the
accreditation status of the course(s) you
want to 
apply for in the choice Institutions before
submitting your application.
What is Accreditation of course? 
Some university offer courses that has not
been approved by the National Universities
Commission
(NUC) , and if you end up in one of those
departments, you would have wasted your
years for nothing! Because you won't be
given any original certificate! For example;
Medicine and Surgery has NOT been
accredited in the Benue State University,
BSUM and many others
Universities, and candidates who is
admitted into
BSUM will end up spending 8+ years in vain.
How will you know if your course has been
accredited in your choice institution?
You can know this from the Jamb 
Brochure that will be given to you when
you purchase the Jamb UTME
Form which is Compiled in CD,the content of the CD can be viewed on System. 
<BR />




<b>Tips 4</b>. Most Institutions requires a cut-off 
of 240
in the JAMB-UTME. (example of such
institution is
University of Ilorin ) the minimum cut off
for Medicine in Unilorin is 240 and 220+ for
major courses, while admission at the
University of Ibadan and Unilag begins with
your O-Level results, herefore, its very
important that you have the basic
requirements of the Institution before
applying for admission. In fact, this apply to
almost all the Institutions in Nigeria. Ensure
you have your COMPLETE O'LEVEL RESULTS
for your chosen courses before buying
Jamb, if you don't have, you are only going
to frustrate yourself. Even when you are
admitted, you will be screen out after they
collect your acceptance fee and school fee.
Tips 9. DO NOT apply for admission into
Institutions outside your catchment areas,
else, you risk your chance of being
admitted.<br />


<b>Tips 5</b>. Take note: Once you have
submitted your
application form for the JAMB 
UTME,
there is no more opportunity to initial any
therefore, we advice candidates to check all
the
fields properly, including passport, names,
first and
second institutions, finger prints before
submission, because all would be verified
before you are admitted.<br />
