(1) Believe in Yourself and kill any Limiting Factor

First and foremost you will Erase the limiting
belief that you can not
pass your exam.<br />
<br />
Exam can easily be pass when you apply the
right concept and strategy.<br />
Its not new that people fail exam for not
having believe in themselves to succeed.<br />
<br />
If you believe you can pass or you
believe you cannot pass, you are right.<br />
 I have seen students under the 
impression that examiner is their enemy.<br />
<br />
Please
don't think so. Pass percentage might be
low,
but students do pass their exams. So, don't
think 
that you will be in a failure category ever.<br />
From today change your mind set and have
the believe that you can pass your
forthcoming post utme exam, Wace , neco or
GCE<br />
<br />

question is so enormous and it is vital for
anyone the have the determination to succeed

any exam.<br />

3. Taking down important notes;<br />
<br />
Whenever you are reading or studying for 
any exam, it is essential to write down
important point for future references and for
quick reminder whenever exam is knocking at
You.<br />
<br />
" Prepare for exams by way of  taking short note
which you can recall quickly at the time of
taking 
exam. This will help in two manner. First,
when
you write, you are in better picture of giving
your mind instruction through written letters.<br />
Secondly, you can revise from your notes
instead of opening the book when exam day
is
near. <BR>Here is my strategy for taking notes; <br />
"Take a paper and divide into two<br />
"<br />
" Write down important points, important<br />
concepts
and key ideas which you need to remember.<br />
" These notes should be used at the time
when paper is on head and you need to
revise 
whole subject in two to three hours.<br />
<br />
44) Remembering / memorizing key idea's
and formulae
Do you know that most of the student that
use cramming will end up passing any 
examination, though too much of cramming is
not good but you need it to succeed in your
Exam<br />
" One of the key ideas to memorize ideas
e.g. formulae, is to write them in small charts
and hang it in front of your bed.<br />
" See those formulae daily before going to
bed and rising up.<br />
" Use different colours and markers.<br />
" Believe me, in my statistics paper, I was
recalling the formulae in the exact colours
which
I wrote on charts.<br />
5. Say No To Time Wasting;<br />
There is need for you to do proper calculation
when you are in the examination.<br />
Some student fail simply because they Lack
time Management.<br />

Wasting too many time on a question is bad<br />
ethics.<br />
Moreso, the number of your question should
determine the number of minute you should
allocate to 1 question.<br />
For exam.<br />
<br />
50 question for 1 hour.<br />
If you use 2 minute to answer 1 question,
you will only attempt 30 question out of 50
and you are likely to fail.<br />
To pass exam with 50 question and 1 hour,
you must not use more than 1 minute 12
seconds on 1 question.<br />
<br />
Go Now and pass Any examination.<br />
