<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS ON THE FINAL MARKING SCHEME</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>1.</strong></span><span style="color:#333399;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">DISTRIBUTION OF MARKS</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>There are two parts in this paper. Parts I and II</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>Each of the questions in Part I carries 8 marks while each question in Part II carries 12 marks. The five questions in part I carry 40 marks and the five questions to be answer by the candidate in Part II sum up to 60 marks.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>The grand total for this paper is, therefore, 100 marks.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>2.</strong></span><span style="color:#333399;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">TYPES OF MARKS</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>Three types of marks are awarded during the process of marking the answer scripts.</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>Method marks (M) are given for the use of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">correct</span> method. The correct method should lead to the correct answer if numerical errors or miscalculation are not committed.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>Accuracy marks (A) are earned when the answer is correct as given in the marking scheme. When the method mark is zero, the immediate <a class="zem_slink" title="Accuracy and precision" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">accuracy</a> marks are also lost.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>Bonus marks (B) are awarded for correct accuracy, marks are not preceded by method marks. Bonus marks combine both method and  accuracy marks together.</strong></span><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>Follow through bonus marks (B) are awarded in special situations where the candidate&#8217;s  wrong  values are used correctly in the subsequent working. E.g. plotting of the candidate's wrong values correctly in drawing a graph.</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NOTE:</span> The M. A. and B marks cannot be split or subdivided. E.g. where an M1 mark is allocated the candidate either scores the M1 fully (if the method is correct) or M0 (when the method is wrong). The same applies to the A and B marks.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>3.</strong></span><span style="color:#333399;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">PENALTIES</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong> Marks are deducted from the candidates work as follows:</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>Deduct 1 mark for wrong units (W.U) or omitted units (O.U) once only in a question.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>Deduct 1 mark from wrong reasons (W.R) or omitted reasons (O.R) in geometric proofs once only in a question.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>Deduct 2 marks for misreading (MR) the data in a question. (If the misread values are used correctly in the subsequent calculation).</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>Deduct 1 mark for premature approximation which does not make the subsequent working considerably easier.</strong></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>Deduct 1 mark for the omission of an essential working step.<br />
</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">NOTE:</span>  </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(i) Marks can only be deducted from accuracy and bonus marks and not from method marks.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(ii) Certain deductions are specifically stated in some questions in the marking scheme E.g ½ mark for each error or 1 mark for each error.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(iii) Award zero mark if candidate's work is not clearly presented or indecipherable.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(iv) Award zero mark if working is totally suppressed.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">4.OTHER POINTS TO NOTE</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(i). Where a candidate attempts more than five questions in section B, mark the entire candidate’s work and delete marks for the extra marks for the extra questions with the lowest marks. Write MQA – More Questions Answered in front of each deleted mark.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(ii). All further workings which appears beyond the first appearance of the correct answer should be ignored.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(iii). The marking scheme contains some alternative methods (Aliter) in some questions. Other correct equivalent methods which are not included in the marking should be accepted and the corresponding M. A and B marks should be awarded.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(1v)      Do not round up individual question total (where ½ marks are awarded). It is the final total mark (on 100) that should be rounded up to the nearest whole number)</strong></span></p><br><br><br>



<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#008000;">1.INTRODUCTION</span></strong><br />
<strong>Many students can pass Mathematics if they understand how <a class="zem_slink" title="WAEC" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=33.729323,-84.32201&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=33.729323,-84.32201%20%28WAEC%29&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation" rel="nofollow">WAEC</a> examiners mark their papers and if their tutors show them the way practically by marking  their scripts same way during school tests. Unfortunately many tutors fail to understand the importance of <span style="color:#ff0000;"><a href="https://lagosbooksclub.wordpress.com/2013/10/31/maths-made-easy-free-download-past-questions-and-answers-for-revision-learn-the-6-step-formula-for-solving-all-maths-problems/"><span style="color:#ff0000;">the-6-step-formula</span></a></span> and <span style="color:#ff0000;"><a href="https://lagosbooksclub.wordpress.com/2013/11/04/more-free-download-of-maths-past-questions-and-answers-for-revision-maths-etiquette-for-examinations-homework/"><span style="color:#ff0000;">maths-etiquette</span></a></span> to be observed as stated in detail below.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#008000;"><strong>2. HOW EXAMINERS AWARD MARKS</strong></span><br />
<strong>i. Marks are subdivided into</strong><br />
<strong> a. Method (M)</strong><br />
<strong> b. Accuracy (A)</strong><br />
<strong> c. Independent accuracy marks not preceded by M mark (B)</strong><br />
<strong> ii. The M mark is given for a particular stage if the method used is correct. That is if correctly done without numerical errors yielding the right answer. M marks are not subdivided and unless the M marks for a stage have been awarded no A marks can be gained for that stage</strong><br />
<strong> iii. Examiners will deduct 2 marks if you misread and present the data given falsely.</strong><br />
<strong> iv. Examiners will deduct 1 mark for an answer not given to the accuracy asked for.</strong><br />
<strong> v. Deductions under iii and iv above shall not be more than once on each occasion in one question</strong><br />
<strong> vi. 1 mark is deductible for premature approximations which do not considerably simplify the subsequent work. Deductions can only be made from A or B marks and not from M marks.</strong><br />
<strong> vii. Examiners will give zero for results obtained from work they cannot decipher or which is wholly suppressed and 1 mark is deductible for omission of an essential working (<a class="zem_slink" title="Mathematical proof" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">essential step</a>).</strong><br />
<strong> viii. Once a correct answer is stated examiners will ignore any further workings beyond that stage.</strong><br />
<strong> ix. For geometric proofs 1 mark is deductible for omission of an essential reason or for a wrong reason given. But this should not be more than once in a question.</strong><br />
<strong> x. 1 mark is to be deducted for omission of units or for wrong units. But this should not be more than once in a question.</strong><br />
<strong> xi. If a single question is attempted on more than one occasion the mark for the best attempt is to be awarded to the student.SOS (see other solutions) shall be written against the others</strong><br />
<strong> xii. If more questions are attempted than the rubric allows the lowest marks per those extra questions will be deleted. MQA meaning MORE <a class="zem_slink" title="Question" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">QUESTIONS</a> ANSWERED will be indicated by the examiner to indicate he was aware while marking.</strong><br />
<strong> xiii. Unless otherwise stated, equivalent methods not specified in the <a class="zem_slink" title="Marking scheme" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marking_scheme" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">marking scheme</a> will be accepted and given appropriate marks.</strong><br />
<strong> xiv. The final total is 100 marks and will be rounded upwards to the nearest whole number.</strong></p>
