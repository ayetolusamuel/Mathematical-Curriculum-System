		<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;color:#ff0000;"><strong>PREAMBLE</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>Please</strong><strong> find below all topics WAEC expects  candidates would have covered for its exams..They are hereby presented in accordance to the 7 branches of maths whose notes were earlier given.Later we shall give a list of the 100 most frequently asked maths questions by WAEC to compare with this list.Once a school,tutor or student can link such questions to these topics and backwards to their branches they will be better placed managing time allocations during revision periods.They will also be better placed to meander their ways through what looks like maths wilderness.Students in particular should scan through these topics,identify areas that might need further work by their tutors for strategic preparations for WAEC  maths exams.These lists were strategically prepared by EDUPEDIA from major maths textbooks from JSS1 to SS3.</strong></span></p>
